[metalsmith]: http://metalsmith.io

This blog now runs on [metalsmith]. hexo made me nuts when I tried to update it to the newest version. So I decided to switch to an engine where I have more control over what is actually happening.

metalsmith looked nice; it's more a `framework` with which you can build static site generators (among other thinks). That means: you have absolute control .. but you have to do most of the stuff on your own (at least plug together the right plugins).

Nevertheless .. it was fun porting the blog to it :)
